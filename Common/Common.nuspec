            The utility classes and extension methods I tend to pull along with me as I move from project to project. I basically got tired of re-writing them. Also as they slowly morphed, I wouldn't be sure which past project I should refer to when I was starting a new project (to make sure I got the latest and greatest). This package will hopefully solve that problem!

            Keep in mind that I created this with me in mind. The contents are subject to change on a whim and without notice. If you have a project with this included, it's more than likely because I was a consultant for you (or your employer). Update with care!
