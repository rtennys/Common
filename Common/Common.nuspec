            The utility classes and extension methods I tend to pull along with me as I move from
            project to project. I basically got tired of re-writing them. Also as they slowly morphed, I wouldn't
            be sure which past project I should refer to when I was starting a new project (to make sure I got
            the latest and greatest). This package will hopefully solve that problem!
